A simple template with everything you need:  
Upload-ready Netlify form, animated buttons and easy to customize CSS.

## Netlify Form
There is no extra configuration needed. If you upload it to Netlify as it is, it will work with build in spam protection. You can set up getting the messages via email, too. Check out the [documentation](https://docs.netlify.com/forms/setup/) for this, or watch [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/6ElQ689HRcY) if you prefer a video.  
If you know what you're doing, you can set up submission [with AJAX/XHR](https://docs.netlify.com/forms/setup/#submit-html-forms-with-ajax) and configure [spam filtering](https://docs.netlify.com/forms/spam-filters/). 

## Links
Just change the `href`attribute of the `<a>`tags to the new link, and you'll be fine.

## Customizing Color & Font
To customize the color theme, just change the CSS variables in the declaration for `:root`.  
To change the font, replace the three `<link>` tags linking to [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) and the associated `--font` declaration to the Name of the font. 

## Icons
The icons used are from [icons8](https://icons8.com/). On that page are a lot of different icons in SVG inline format, you probably find what you need there.  
If you don't want to attribute the site, consider replacing them or buying a license on the site (pricing seems fair).
